[The puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

Solutions:

[Day 1: Historian Hysteria](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc01.nb.html)

[Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc02.nb.html)

[Day 3: Mull It Over](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc03.nb.html)

[Day 4: Ceres Search](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc04.nb.html)

[Day 5: Print Queue](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc05.nb.html) &ndash;
my favourite so far, using a DAG and topological sort to speed through part 2.
Graph algorithms using {igraph}.

[Day 6: Guard Gallivant](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc06.nb.html)
&ndash; wasn't feeling this one. Completed part 1 fairly quickly. Thought 
of an easy way to complete part 2, but it took 4 hours to run. It did eventually
spit out the correct answer.

[Day 7: Bridge Repair](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc07.nb.html)
&ndash; part 1 easy, part 2 needed a cleverer search but brute force worked in an
hour. I don't have time right now to do better; however, it's an interesting
puzzle, so I may revisit at some point. Uses {gmp} for large integers,
which works very well.

[Day 8: Resonant Collinearity](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc08.nb.html)
&ndash; part 1 easy, using a linear regression model on n=2 (no regrets). Part 2
was an easy extension, so glad I used OLS.
