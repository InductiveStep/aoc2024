[The puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

Solutions:

[Day 1: Historian Hysteria](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc01.nb.html)

[Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc02.nb.html)

[Day 3: Mull It Over](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc03.nb.html)

[Day 4: Ceres Search](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc04.nb.html)

[Day 5: Print Queue](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc05.nb.html) --
my favourite so far, using a DAG and topological sort to speed through part 2.

[Day 6: Guard Gallivant](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc06.nb.html)
-- wasn't feeling this one. Completed part 1.

[Day 7: Bridge Repair](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2024/aoc07.nb.html)
-- part 1 easy, part 2 needed a cleverer search but brute force worked in an
hour. I don't have time right now to do better; however, it's an interesting
puzzle so may revisit...
